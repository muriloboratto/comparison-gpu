# Comparison APIs on GPU Environment

This repository contains the material corresponding to the webinar/Hands-on: _Comparison APIs on GPU Environment_. The objectives are:

1. **Present** quickly and objectively concepts of Code Portability and Optimization;
2. **Show** through simple examples the use of Parallel and Distributed Programming in GPU systems;
3. **Expose** students to applicability in case studies.

Material available in \*.ipynb (Jupyter NoteBook) format. There is 1 notebook in this repository:
